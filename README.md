# AI_engineer_project
I'm dedicated to becoming an Artificial Intelligence engineer. Follow my journey on GitHub as I document my progress in machine learning and deep learning.



In the coming months, I will be focused on my journey to become an Artificial Intelligence engineer. In my GitHub repository, I will document my progress as I learn essential concepts in machine learning and deep learning. This repository will serve as a detailed record of my development over time. I invite everyone to follow along my journey and contribute with insights and constructive comments.
